    "We can also visualize the trajectories of agents. One way is to run the web demo with the agents you choose, and the specific instructions can be found in the [overcooked_demo](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai/tree/master/src/overcooked_demo) module, which requires some setup. Another simpler way is to use the StateVisualizer, which uses the information returned by the AgentEvaluator to create a simple dynamic visualization. You can checkout [this Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AAVP2P-QQhbx6WTOnIG54NXLXFbO7y6n#scrollTo=6Xlu54MkiXCR) that let you play with fixed agents"
